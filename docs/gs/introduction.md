# Introduction

Vuxel is a modern UI framework for Roblox inspired by the Vue.js design pattern. It provides a structured, component-based approach to building reactive UIs using state management, templating, and hooks. This guide will walk you through setting up your first Vuxel application and help you understand its core features.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into Vuxel, you should be familiar with basic Luau scripting and Roblox Studio. Ensure you have the following:

1. Roblox Studio installed.
2. Basic knowledge of Instances and Roblox UI elements.
3. Some understanding of state management (if not, this guide will cover it).
